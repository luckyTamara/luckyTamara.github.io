        <p>I am Tamara. I was born in Chongqing. I graduate from Shanghai Universty of International Buiness and Economicsand major
            in Information Management and System Program. I started learning English since I was 12 years old. My parents have a
            lot of American friends. That's why I have no problem communicating with Americans or others by speaking English.
        
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to do anything relating to English such as listening to English songs, watching English movies or
            TV programs, or even attending the activities held by some English clubs or institutes. I used to go abroad for a short-term
            English study. During that time, I learned a lot of daily life English and saw a lot of different things.;
        
        </p>
        <br>I think language is very interesting. I could express one substance by using different sounds. So I wish I could study and
        read more English literatures and enlarge my knowledge</p>
